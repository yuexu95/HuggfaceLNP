    ### 📑 Explore the Tools
    
    Navigate through the sidebar to access different modules:

    #### 🔬 **General Info**
    Overview of LNP fundamentals, formulation concepts, and calculation principles for both pDNA and mRNA.

    #### 🧬 **LNP Formulation Calculator**
    Standard calculator for pDNA and mRNA formulations with N/P ratio calculations, detailed volume breakdowns, and batch scaling.

    #### 💊 **FDA-Approved Formulations**
    Pre-configured formulations based on FDA-approved LNP products (Onpattro®, Comirnaty®, Spikevax®, etc.) for reference and replication.

    #### 🀄 **LNP-Flow: Professional DOE Designer**
    High-throughput Design of Experiments (DOE) tool for systematic LNP optimization:
    - Multi-factor screening (lipid ratios, N/P, flow rates, etc.)
    - Full factorial and fractional designs
    - Lab-ready run sheets with randomization
    - Batch generation for 96-well formats

    #### 📚 **References**
    Key literature, protocols, and resources for LNP formulation knowledge.

    #### ⚗️ **5th Component Calculator**
    Advanced calculator for LNP formulations with an additional lipid or functional component beyond the standard 4-component system.

    #### 🔬 **Multi-step LNP with DNA-Binding Compounds**
    Specialized calculator for pre-complexing DNA with binding compounds (protamine, peptides, polymers) before LNP formation.
